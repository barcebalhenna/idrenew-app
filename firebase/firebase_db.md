# IDRenew - Firebase Backend Documentation

As per Requirement #3 (Access to source code and database-related files), this document provides the 'database schema definitions' for our mobile application. 
Since we are using Firebase, a NoSQL cloud database, we do not have traditional SQL scripts. Instead, our "schema" is flexibly defined by the data structures within our collections and the logic in our source code.
This file provides screenshots of our live Firebase console to visually demonstrate this structure.
